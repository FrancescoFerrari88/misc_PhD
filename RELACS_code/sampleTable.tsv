An example is:

Sample_Lib_C838_11	ACTACT	Sample1
Sample_Lib_C838_11	TGACTG	Sample2
Sample_Lib_C838_11	default	Sample3

The "Illumina sample" column corresponds to a directory with fastq files, as produced by bcl2fastq2.

Any observed barcode that does not match a barcode listed in the file (with a possible mismatch of 1) will be written to the sample specified by 'default'. Note that all barcodes must be of the same length.

This script must be run in directory containing subdirectories each having fastq files. This is the default structure output by bcl2fastq2 and our internal demultiplexing pipeline.
